Benefits of this version:

‚úÖ Reuses connection across requests in the same serverless instance (reduces latency and MongoDB load).

‚úÖ Simple and readable.

‚úÖ Safe for Vercel‚Äôs ephemeral environment ‚Äî works even when instances are spun up and down.

‚úÖ Handles higher traffic better than the fully simplified version.

Limitations:

‚ö†Ô∏è Still depends on serverless instance caching ‚Äî if Vercel spins up new instances, a new connection is made.

‚ö†Ô∏è For extremely high-traffic apps, you may need connection pooling or a managed serverless MongoDB setup like Atlas.
